# dots-and-boxes

For the graphics it uses John Zelle's graphics.py from the book "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle & Associates) which can be found at http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py

The program is split into two parts: game1.py and board.py. 
## board.py
board.py contains the code for a gameboard class which is used to construct the game in game1.py.
## game1.py
game1.py also contains code which actually runs the game and code for the AI to follow.
